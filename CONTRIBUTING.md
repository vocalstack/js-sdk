# Contributing to VocalStack JS SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the VocalStack JS SDK! Contributions are welcome in the form of bug fixes, new features, and general improvements. Below are the guidelines to help ensure a smooth contribution process.

## How to Contribute

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a feature branch to work on your changes:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**: Make the necessary changes or improvements.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your changes and submit a pull request to the main repository. Please provide a clear description of what your changes address and any relevant context.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep pull requests small and focused.

- Ensure that your changes follow the coding standards of the repository.

- Contributions will be reviewed and merged at the discretion of the maintainers.

## Coding Standards

- **1 Issue/Feature = 1 Branch = 1 PR**: This is the ideal scenario that we should aim for.

- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that convey the purpose of the change.

- **Code Formatting**: Ensure that your code follows consistent formatting and uses linting tools to detect issues.

- **Please respond to review conversations**: Please respond to review feedback in writing, even if it is just one word or a thumbs up. To make it easier for the reviewer, do not resolve a review comment that someone else raised. Wait for that person to resolve that comment.
